# Cognitive model
Cognitive model for a categorization task in an experiment that was conducted in real life. The values that the model produces are compared to the data of the experiment. In the experiment participants learned how sets of three symptoms relate to disease A,B or C. The symptoms were divided into three dimensions. When participants were able to recall diseases based on symptoms they saw, they were shown a test set with different constellations of symptoms. They were then asked to classify sets of 3 symptoms to disease A, B or C. The model aims to explain how people classify constellations of syptoms they have not seen before based on the categorization they learned.
